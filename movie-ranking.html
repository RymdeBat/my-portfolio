    <h3>Perfume: The Story of a Murderer 2006</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume:_The_Story_of_a_Murderer_(film)" target="_blank"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hJnR1JqBL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt="Image poster of Perfume Movie 2006" title="Click to spoil yourself ü§£ü§£"></a>

    <p>Mind blown movie for me, it's about a man who is obsess of love and affection that he did not get from his childhood, unintentionally knowing that what he did is an act of a hideous crimes that forever marks in the history of mankind. A movie worth to watch.</p>

    <p>Is an american action film, which is about rescuing the boy. This movie is so engaging to watch. I love how they introduce indian culture in this film and the action cinematics are so breath-taking. I enjoy every fight scenes.</p>

    <p>I love the animation of this film. It showcase what the love of family is all about and acceptance of each parents and kids flaws. It represents culture, diversity and unity.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Where The Crawdads Sing 2022</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Crawdads_Sing_(film)" target="_blank" title="Click to spoil yourself ü§£ü§£"><img src="https://lsf.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/where_the_crawdads_sing_untuk_sensor_untuk_sensor_page-0001.jpg" alt="Image Posteer of WTCS"></a>
    <p>Based on a novel with the same name by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Newman" target="_blank" title="Author of Where The Crawdads Sing Novel 2018">Olivia Newman</a>. Best movie for me, because of it's unique story telling about the girl who live independently but still seeking for love and kindness to other people.
    There is a plot wist at the end of the movies that blown my mind. Most recommended movie for those introvert people like me. üòÅüòÄüòÅ</p>
